1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
ans:
hadoop fs -put sales_data.csv /tmp/hive_data

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
create table sales_order_csv (
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties('skip.header.line.count'='1');

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
ans:
load data inpath '/tmp/hive_data/sales-data.csv' into table sales_order_csv ;
5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
create table sales_order_orc(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc ;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
ans:
from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select * ;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year

select year_id ,sum(year_id) as total_sales
from sales_order_orc
group by year_id ;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select *
from sales_order
where quantityordered = (select max(quantityordered) from sales_order) ;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

select qtr_id,round(sum(sales),2) total_sales
from sales_order
group by qtr_id ;
d. In which quarter sales was minimum

select qtr_id
from sales_order
where sales = (select min(sales) from sales_order)
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum

select country,sales 
from sales_order
where sales = (select max(sales) from sales_order)
union
select country,sales 
from sales_order
where sales = (select min(sales) from sales_order);

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city

select city,sum(sales)as qtr_sales
from sales_order
group by qtr_id,city
order by qtr_id ;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold 

select month_id,year_id,
max(quantityordered) over(partition by year_id,month_id)  as max_quantity_sold
from sales_order;
